  BUILDING BLOCK for interactive Sigma "cohort builder" data apps from code
  (workbooks-as-code, POST/PUT /v2/workbooks/spec) — an agent-driven population
  SEGMENTATION tool: filter a population of individual records (customers, patients,
  employees, students, members, accounts) down to a named, saveable cohort, see live
  size/rate KPIs and distributions, then compare saved cohorts against each other. For
  a full branded company dashboard / POV (which already includes page 1), use
  **sigma-company-dashboard** — it will ASK which of this skill or
  **sigma-input-table-app** (scenario modeling) fits the prospect before building page
  2. Use this DIRECTLY when the deliverable is specifically "build a customer/patient/
  member cohort", "segment a population", "let an agent narrow down a cohort by
  filters", or similar — population segmentation, NOT numeric projection under
  assumptions (that's sigma-input-table-app). Encodes the VERIFIED tabbed-container,
  agent-tool-per-filter, wide-snapshot-save, and grouped-table-sort shapes plus the
  hard limits, so it comes out right the FIRST time.

# Sigma Cohort Builder — population segmentation app

Given "let a user (or an agent) filter a population down to a named cohort, save it,
and compare saved cohorts," build this via `POST/PUT /v2/workbooks/spec`. Reverse-
engineered from a real production workbook (demeng org's Marketing Control Center,
"Cohort Construction App" page) and verified end-to-end on staging. Pair with
`sigma-company-dashboard` for the read-only dashboard half, and see
`[[sigma-code-rep-interactivity]]` / `[[agent-cohort-builder-pattern]]` (memory) for
the deeper gotcha history this skill is distilled from.

## When to use this vs. sigma-input-table-app

Ask the user which fits before building — don't guess (some prospects are genuinely
ambiguous, e.g. a retailer could plausibly want either):

- **Cohort Builder (this skill)** — filter a POPULATION of individual records down to
  a named, saveable segment. Fits marketing (campaign segments), healthcare (patient
  risk/diagnosis cohorts), HR (attrition-risk employee groups), education (at-risk
  student groups), SaaS (churn-risk user segments), nonprofit (donor segments).
- **Scenario Modeler (`sigma-input-table-app`)** — project a NUMBER forward under
  adjustable drivers/assumptions. Fits finance, manufacturing, insurance, supply
  chain, energy.
- **Both** is a valid answer — build a dashboard page-1, then one page each.

## The architecture (4 pieces)

1. **A population base table** (`kind:"table"`, custom SQL or `GENERATOR`-based
   synthetic data) with the dimensions worth segmenting by — age/demographic band,
   region, a lifecycle/condition/segment category, a binary flag worth isolating
   ("Is Lapsed" / "Care Gap" / "At Risk"), and a cost/revenue/value measure. An
   independent, UNFILTERED **baseline** copy of the same query (a separate element id)
   gives you an always-on "vs total population" comparison.
2. **One filter `control` per dimension** — ordinary `controlType:"list"` with
   `selectionMode:"multiple"`, each with the standard `filters:[{source:{kind:"table",
   elementId:"population"},columnId}]` binding, PLUS a numeric floor/threshold control
   (`controlType:"number"`) and text controls for the cohort's Name/Description.
3. **ONE AGENT TOOL PER FILTER DIMENSION** — the actual trick. Instead of one tool
   with many params, a separate tiny `action` tool per filter, each just ONE
   `set-control-value` effect with `value:{type:"agent-input",inputName:"..."}`
   (`selectionMode:"add"` on the multi-select ones so the agent can build up a filter
   across turns without wiping prior selections). Add a "set cohort name & description"
   tool (2 effects) and a "save the cohort" tool (see #4).
4. **Save = a real `insert-rows` into an append-only input table** — NOT a UI-only
   Action Sequence (which cannot be authored from code; if a reference workbook's
   "Save" button turns out to be a `{"kind":"sequence","sequenceId":...}` reference,
   that ID isn't defined anywhere in the GET-back spec and can't be replicated —
   inline the real effects instead).

## Non-negotiable defaults — build these every time

1. **Snapshot a WIDE set of scalar numbers at Save time — never try to serialize the
   filter criteria as text.** `Text()` on a MULTI-select control returns its full
   OPTIONS list, not the current selection (verified) — so storing "Age Filter" /
   "Region Filter" as `Text([ctrl])` silently captures the wrong (always-the-same)
   data. Instead compute each breakdown as a formula over the LIVE-filtered
   population at Save time (`CountDistinct(If([Population/Dim]="X",[Population/ID],
   Null))`) and store one NUMERIC column per breakdown — cohort size, total value,
   avg value/entity, a rate or two (e.g. flag-rate), and a count per bucket of your
   main demographic dimension. `insert-rows` only ever writes ONE row per action (no
   bulk insert) — this wide-row-per-save design is what makes later analysis possible
   without needing to reconstruct membership.
2. **Analyze a saved cohort with a small cross-join + `Switch` unpivot** — the same
   technique as a scenario modeler's dynamic date-grain/color-by toggle. Cross-join
   the saved-cohorts table × a tiny label table (one row per bucket of your main
   demographic dimension) via `source:{kind:"join",joins:[{left,right,columns:[{left:
   "1",right:"1"}],joinType:"left-outer"}],primarySource:left}`, then a `Switch(
   [Labels/Label],"18-24",[Saved/Age 18-24 Count],...)` formula picks the right stored
   count per label, feeding a real bar chart instead of a flat wide table.
3. **The analysis picker must carry NO `filters` block.** A `list` control's
   `filters:[...]` auto-filters EVERY element sourcing from that table — giving the
   "which saved cohort to analyze" picker a `filters` targeting the saved-cohorts
   table would silently collapse the "all saved cohorts" comparison table/chart down
   to just the one being analyzed. Instead give the picker no `filters` at all (it
   still populates its dropdown via `source`) and match it explicitly in every
   downstream formula: `SumIf(...,[Saved/Cohort Name]=[CohortPick])` / `MaxIf(...)`.
4. **Auto-select the just-saved cohort.** Both Save paths (button AND the agent's
   save tool) fire a SECOND effect right after `insert-rows`: `set-control-value` on
   the analysis picker sourced from the CURRENT Cohort Name control value
   (`{"type":"control","control":"CohortName"}`). No timestamp/Lookup needed — it's
   exactly the name just used.
5. **"Top N" table = a GROUPED table with `sort`, not a plain table's `sort`/`limit`
   (those are silently dropped).** For a "top members/customers by value" preview
   (the stand-in for a repeated-container card view, which isn't buildable from code
   yet), use `groupings:[{id,groupBy:[...all displayed dims...],calculations:[
   valueColId],sort:[{columnId:valueColId,direction:"descending"}]}]` — group by every
   displayed column at the SAME grain as the raw data (no real aggregation, just a
   sort lever) and give it a compact fixed height so only the top rows show without
   scrolling.
6. **`inputMode:"explore"` on the saved-cohorts input table** (not the default
   `"edit"`) if you want it editable by non-editor viewers in the PUBLISHED
   workbook — `"edit"` restricts writes to workbook editors in DRAFT mode only, which
   silently breaks a published agent/button Save for anyone else. `inputMode` enum:
   `edit` (editors, draft only) · `explore` (explore-or-greater, published) · `view`
   (everyone, published).

## Layout: a 2-tab tabbed container (verified working shape)

Mirror the reference's real structure: ONE page containing a `tabbed-container` with
exactly 2 tabs — "Cohort Builder" (filters + agent + a row-level detail table + Save/
Reset) and "Visualize" (comparative KPIs + distributions + the saved-cohort analysis
section). Keep a separate "Saved Cohorts" page for comparing many saved cohorts
against each other (a genuinely different function). Verified JSON element:
```json
{"id":"tc","kind":"tabbed-container","tabs":[{"name":"Tab A"},{"name":"Tab B"}],"tabBar":{"alignment":"start"}}
```
Layout XML wraps it with a real `<Tab>` child per tab, matched by POSITION (no name
attribute) — `tabs[]` in the JSON element are LABELS ONLY:
```xml
<TabbedContainer elementId="tc" type="tabbed-container" gridColumn="1 / 25" gridRow="7 / 60">
  <Tab gridTemplateColumns="repeat(24, 1fr)" gridTemplateRows="auto">
    <LayoutElement elementId="..." gridColumn="..." gridRow="..."/>
  </Tab>
  <Tab gridTemplateColumns="repeat(24, 1fr)" gridTemplateRows="auto">
    <LayoutElement elementId="..." gridColumn="..." gridRow="..."/>
  </Tab>
</TabbedContainer>
```

**⚠ GOTCHA — nesting a `<GridContainer>` INSIDE a `<Tab>` scrambles render order.**
Elements can render wildly out of their declared order with large unexplained gaps
(a chart declared LAST rendered FIRST) even though POST/PUT accepts the structure
(masked, as always). Only bare `<LayoutElement>` children of a `<Tab>` are verified to
render in the order declared. **Fix: never wrap a gradient/styled card in a
`GridContainer` inside a Tab** — apply `style.backgroundColor` directly on the leaf
element (a `kpi-chart`'s own `style`) instead of a wrapping container. A `GridContainer`
used for something structurally necessary (e.g. an agent chat panel with a header
above it) still seems fine — the risk is specifically wrapping simple KPI-style cards
that don't need a container at all.

**⚠ GOTCHA — `style.padding` only accepts the literal `"none"` or must be omitted
entirely.** `"padding":"medium"` (or any other value) is rejected — default padding is
implied by omitting the field.

**⚠ GOTCHA — a `list` control has NO code-representable default/initial selected
value.** Both `"defaultValue":{"type":"formula",...}` and `"value":{"type":"formula",
...}` POST "successfully" but are silently dropped on GET-back (the classic
masked-unknown-field trap). There is no way from code to make a picker auto-select
"the most recent row" on first page load — the auto-select-after-Save effect (#4
above) is the real, working substitute; a freshly (re)deployed/never-saved workbook
will show an empty/null analysis section until someone clicks Save once, and that's
expected, not a bug. Add a small hint line near the picker saying so instead of
leaving a bare "null" on screen.

**⚠ GOTCHA — `AvgIf` is NOT a real Sigma formula function.** `SumIf`/`CountDistinct`/
`MaxIf` are the confirmed conditional aggregates; `MaxIf` is the safe substitute for
an average whenever exactly one row is expected to match a condition (`Max` of one
value is trivially that value). Don't assume every `<Agg>If` naming pattern exists.

## Workflow

1. Ask up front: what population is being segmented, what dimensions matter, and
   whether the deliverable is standalone or part of a full company-dashboard build
   (in which case coordinate with `sigma-company-dashboard`'s theming/logo/plugin
   conventions so both pages match).
2. Build a Python generator that emits the spec; POST to create, then always PUT to
   the SAME workbook id on every subsequent edit (re-POSTing creates a duplicate
   workbook with the same name — if that happens, delete the stale one via
   `DELETE /v2/files/{workbookId}`, not `/v2/workbooks/{id}` which 404s).
3. Verify structurally after every PUT: GET the spec back, regex-parse the `<Tab>`
   blocks' `elementId` order and confirm no stray `<GridContainer>` snuck inside one,
   and confirm any `groupings[].sort` you added kept its `direction` value
   (`"ascending"`/`"descending"`, not the abbreviated `"asc"`/`"desc"` — the
   abbreviated form silently vanishes on GET-back).
4. Hand the user the URL — you can't render Sigma from a headless session, so the one
   thing you can't verify yourself is the actual on-screen layout; ask them to
   confirm it after any layout-affecting change.

## Files
- `examples/build_cohort_builder_reference.py` — the canonical generator: synthetic
  2000-row population, 6 filter controls + name/description, an 8-tool agent (one per
  filter + name-and-description + save), 2-tab tabbed container (Builder/Visualize),
  flat-stat comparative KPI cards, a value-distribution histogram, a demographic-
  distribution bar, a grouped+sorted "Top N" table, and a saved-cohorts analysis
  section (picker + cross-join/Switch unpivot + auto-select-after-save). Swap the
  population's SQL/column names for your domain — the mechanic doesn't change.
