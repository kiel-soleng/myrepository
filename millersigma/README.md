# millersigma

A Claude Code **plugin** bundling Connor Miller's Sigma Computing skills — one
home for everything that helps Claude build Sigma workbooks, dashboards, embed
portals, and plugins. Install it once and every skill below becomes available
in any project.

## Which skill do I use? (START HERE)

**Building a branded Sigma dashboard / POV / demo for a company? → use `sigma-company-dashboard-v2`. One config, whole app, seven companies proven. Use `sigma-company-dashboard` (v1) only for a one-off outside that pattern.**

It's the flagship, end-to-end builder and it *composes* the others for you (layout, styling, conventions, write-back). Everything else is a building block or a different deliverable:

- ⭐ **`sigma-company-dashboard-v2`** — the current front door. Same output as v1 (real fetched logo, comparative KPI cards, live AI insight, a bespoke plugin, a scenario-modeler page, a cohort builder) but ONE generator + ONE config file instead of a hand-authored script per prospect. Proven across sofi, boa, elevance, mcd, abry, nuvia, delta, marriott. Supports building just a subset of surfaces (command center only, etc). Read its `reference/HANDOFF.md` in full before writing any code — it is the complete operating manual.
- **`sigma-company-dashboard`** (v1) — the original hand-authored flagship. Kept for one-off builds that don't fit the config pattern; new work should default to v2.
- `sigma-input-table-app` — a standalone data app / scenario modeler / forecasting / write-back tool (only when *that* is the whole ask).
- `branded-dashboard-format`, `sigma-workbook-styling`, `sigma-workbook-conventions` — building blocks the flagship uses; call directly only for a specific sub-task.
- `sigma-plugin-development`, `sigma-plugin-patterns` — for building a plugin itself.
- `sigma-embed-portal` — a Netlify embed site. `sigma-use-cases` — a use-case slide deck. `sigma-app-design` — a design doc/PRD.

> ⚠️ **Common mistake:** driving a company build from `branded-dashboard-format` + the building blocks (naming them in your prompt). That produces a *generic* dashboard — no fetched logo, no bespoke plugin. Just say: **"Use `sigma-company-dashboard-v2` to build a Sigma workbook for [Company]."**

## Skills

| Skill | What it does | Dependencies |
|---|---|---|
| ⭐ **sigma-company-dashboard-v2** | **START HERE.** One `company.py` config drives a universal builder (`build_sofi.py` for the workbook, `build_statement.py` for a pixel-perfect PDF report) — no per-company script. Surface selection (command/model/cohort) via env var. Worked examples: sofi, boa, elevance, mcd, abry, nuvia, delta, marriott, spanning fintech, banking, healthcare payer, QSR, PE, dental and airline. Read `reference/HANDOFF.md` first — full architecture, every verified API gotcha, cost economics. | Uses its own `scripts/`, staging API, local plugin host. |
| sigma-company-dashboard (v1) | The original hand-authored flagship — a fresh generator script per company. Superseded by v2 for new work; kept for one-offs. | Uses `scripts/`, staging API, local plugin host. |
| **sigma-input-table-app** | Interactive counterpart to the dashboard skill — build a Sigma **data app** from code: input tables + buttons + action sequences + modals (scenario modelers, forecasting/planning, write-back, submit→approve). Encodes the verified beta workbook-spec shapes (input tables, cross-joins, linked input tables, modal pages, button effects) + the hard limits/workarounds + a full working generator. | Staging API (beta `create-workbook-spec`). |
| **sigma-workbook-conventions** | Authoring/editing/reviewing Sigma workbook & data-model JSON specs — input resolution, naming, layout, control catalog, ID semantics, and the POST-time gotchas. The flagship skill. | Uses `scripts/` (see [Working with the scripts](#working-with-the-scripts)); pairs with the upstream `sigma-api` / `sigma-data-models` skills. |
| **sigma-workbook-styling** | The visual-craft layer — containers as design blocks, images/logos, buttons & actions, and color/spacing/typography to make a workbook look *designed*, not just correct. Honest about what round-trips via spec vs what needs UI finishing. | Pairs with `sigma-workbook-conventions` (mechanics) and `branded-dashboard-format` (brand). |
| **branded-dashboard-format** | The house dashboard format (header/filter-bar → KPI row → trend → detail pivot) + a fill-in brand-kit template. | Prereq: `sigma-workbook-conventions`. |
| **sigma-embed-portal** | Scrape a prospect's site, build a branded Sigma embed portal, deploy via Netlify. Self-contained. | — |
| **sigma-plugin-development** | Full reference for building Sigma plugins with the `@sigmacomputing/plugin` SDK — editor panel, element data, variables, actions, hosting. | — |
| **sigma-plugin-patterns** | Architectural recipes for plugins (JSON settings pattern, etc.). | Pairs with `sigma-plugin-development`. |

## Install as a plugin

This repo is both a plugin and a single-plugin marketplace, so you can install
it directly from GitHub:

```
/plugin marketplace add cmiller-coder/millersigma
/plugin install millersigma@millersigma
```

Skills are auto-discovered from `skills/`. Once installed, they trigger by
description or can be invoked by name.

## External dependency: Sigma's official skills

`sigma-workbook-conventions` and `branded-dashboard-format` build on Sigma's
own agent skills — **`sigma-api`** (OAuth → bearer token) and
**`sigma-data-models`** (data-model spec round-trips). Those ship in Sigma's
official marketplace plugin, not here. Install that separately for full
workbook-authoring capability.

## Authentication

The `scripts/` here call the Sigma REST API and MCP server. They self-bootstrap
from a `.env` file (never committed — see `.gitignore`):

```
SIGMA_BASE_URL=...
SIGMA_CLIENT_ID=...
SIGMA_CLIENT_SECRET=...
```

On first call, `scripts/api/_env.sh` loads `.env`, fetches an OAuth token via
the `sigma-api` skill, and caches it at `/tmp/.sigma_token` (0600, 55-min TTL).
Secrets live only in `.env` and the `Authorization` header — never in specs,
prompts, or notes.

## Working with the scripts

`sigma-workbook-conventions` was authored to run **with a workbook project as
the working directory** — it invokes `scripts/api/*.sh` and
`python3 scripts/*.py` by relative path. Two ways to use it:

1. **Clone-and-work (matches original design).** Clone this repo, add your
   `.env`, and run Claude Code with the repo as the working directory. Scripts
   resolve as-is. Merge `skills/sigma-workbook-conventions/recommended-permissions.json`
   into your `.claude/settings.json` so discovery calls run without prompts.
2. **Installed plugin.** The reference/pattern skills (both plugin skills,
   `sigma-embed-portal`, and the guidance in `branded-dashboard-format`) work
   fully when installed. For the script-driven parts of
   `sigma-workbook-conventions`, reference the plugin's copy via
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/...` or keep a project checkout per option 1.

> Making the scripts fully path-independent (via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`) so the
> workbook skill runs seamlessly as an installed plugin is a planned follow-up.

## Exemplars & the verified build recipe

Every branded workbook here is built by a **Python generator that emits `spec.json`**,
POSTed to `POST /v2/workbooks/spec` (beta), then verified by **data-exporting each
element** (`/v2/workbooks/{id}/export` → poll `/v2/query/{qid}/download`) to confirm no
`Invalid Query` and sane numbers — since the composed pixels can't be seen headlessly.

**Canonical exemplar — copy this, it's the current standard:**

| Exemplar | Shows |
|---|---|
| `skills/sigma-company-dashboard/examples/build_cava.py` | **THE reference build.** Two pages (command center + scenario modeler) on light surfaces: comparative **gradient KPI cards with native, colorable titles** (no SVG-title hacks), a CallText AI insight, control-driven `Switch`/`DateTrunc` filters, a stacked bar w/ drill fields, **side-by-side pivots**, a **bespoke data-bound plugin in a container below the bar**, and **two agents** (a read-only analyst + a Scenario Copilot with an insert-rows tool). Clone it; swap brand + reshape SQL + AI prompt + plugin. |
| `plugins/cava-daypart/` | The matching **bespoke plugin** — a 7×24 day-part heatmap (`@sigmacomputing/plugin` SDK, synthetic fallback). Register via `POST /v2/plugins` → `pluginId`, host it, embed bound to a synthetic operational source. |

**Defaults these encode** (learned the hard way — see each SKILL.md + the
`sigma-code-rep-interactivity` agent-memory cheatsheet):
- **KPIs are comparative gradient cards** with a delta vs a baseline/prior — never plain numbers. Same card format on every page.
- **Titles are NATIVE** — a `text` element or, on a dark/gradient surface, the host element's own title (`kpi-chart` `name` with a `color`). **Never bake title text into an SVG** (it clips and can't reflow); native `text` on a light surface is dark/high-contrast by default.
- **Format with `$.3~s` (auto K/M/B); never hard-code `/1e9` "billions"** — it desyncs the AI summary from the KPI cards.
- **Light surfaces** everywhere (a dark theme makes input tables & dropdowns white-on-white, and forces the banned SVG-title hack).
- **Real logo** via `scripts/fetch_logo.py <domain>`; fall back to a clean typographic wordmark — never let an image model draw the logo.
- **Toggles work via control-driven formulas**, not button actions.
- **Two agents** — a read-only analyst, and a scenario copilot with an `insert-rows` tool (its target input table needs "Editable in published version" in the UI).
- **A bespoke plugin every build**, matched to the industry. Register via `POST /v2/plugins` → `pluginId`; host on the always-on `localhost:8080` agent. **Fixed placement:** wrapped in a card container, in the left column **directly below the bar chart**, agent beside the bar only, pivots below.

## Adding new skills

1. Create `skills/<new-skill-name>/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: <new-skill-name>
   description: >-
     One or two sharp sentences on WHEN to use it — this is what Claude
     matches against, so lead with trigger conditions.
   ---
   ```
2. Add `reference/`, `examples/`, or `assets/` subfolders as needed.
3. Bump `version` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.
4. Commit and push. Installed users pick it up with `/plugin marketplace update millersigma`.

See `docs/skill-authoring.md` for the authoring pattern (sharp descriptions,
`reference/` split by domain, `examples/` with at least one known-good spec).

## Provenance

Consolidated from two upstream repos, now maintained here:
- Workbook/dashboard/embed skills + scripts — originally `RyanLauderback/ryan-workbook-skill`.
- Plugin skills — originally `neil-oliver/sigma-plugin-skills` (frontmatter added here).
