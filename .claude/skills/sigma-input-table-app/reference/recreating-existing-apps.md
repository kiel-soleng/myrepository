# Recreating an existing Sigma app from its live spec

The move: point at any live Sigma workbook, pull its real spec via the API,
and rebuild a **distilled** version from scratch as code — rather than
guessing at a design from a screenshot, or (worse) re-POSTing the GET-back
directly (see the standing rule in `../SKILL.md`: never re-POST a UI-built
workbook's GET-back — round-tripped specs carry stale/UI-only fields that
reject on write).

## Workflow

1. **Resolve the workbook.** `GET /v2/workbooks/{urlId}` accepts the
   `workbookUrlId` straight out of the app URL (`.../workbook/<Name>-<urlId>`)
   and returns the real `workbookId` — no search needed.
2. **Pull the spec.** `GET /v2/workbooks/{workbookId}/spec` returns the full
   YAML. Production apps run into the thousands of lines (multi-page,
   multi-modal, plan/lifecycle machinery) — read it in chunks, don't try to
   hold the whole thing in context at once.
3. **Identify the core interaction loop**, separate from the incidental
   scaffolding. A real demand-planning app example had: (a) an
   actuals-vs-forecast chart + accuracy/bias KPIs, (b) an editable
   assumptions grid feeding an adjusted forecast, (c) multi-plan
   create/submit/approve lifecycle, (d) an AI insight panel. (a) and (b) are
   the mechanic; (c) and (d) are product depth that a "lite" rebuild can
   drop entirely.
4. **Rebuild (b)+(a) using the verified patterns in this skill** —
   `scenario-modeler-pattern.md`'s linked-input-table chain is almost always
   the right shape for "editable assumption → reactive chart/KPI." Don't
   invent a new mechanic (e.g. a standalone slider control referenced
   directly in an unrelated chart's formula) without checking whether it's
   actually a documented, verified primitive first — it likely isn't; Sigma
   controls talk to other elements through `filters` or `effects`
   (`set-control-value`/`update-rows`), not through bare formula references
   to the control's live value.
5. **QA every element** (see `../SKILL.md` Workflow step 4) before calling it
   done, even for a "lite" build — the following gotchas were all first
   caught this way.

## Gotchas hit rebuilding a real Demand Planning app (new, 2026-08-11)

- **⚠ If someone has the workbook open in a browser tab while you iterate on
  it via the API, a UI edit as small as changing one dropdown can silently
  revert ALL of your API fixes back to whatever the tab's client-side state
  was when it first loaded.** Hit this directly: after three separate PUTs
  fixing bugs across a session (verified via export each time — real numbers
  everywhere), the user made one small UI change (an `inputMode` dropdown)
  and the workbook's `documentVersion` bumped, but a fresh `GET /spec`
  showed the *original, most-broken* content — bare unqualified column refs,
  the pre-rename element id, everything. The editor's save action appears to
  write back its own full in-memory document, not a diff against the
  server's current state — so a tab opened before your fixes landed, then
  touched at all, clobbers them wholesale. **Practical rule: after any API
  PUT, tell whoever has the workbook open to hard-refresh the tab before
  making ANY UI edit, even a trivial one** — or don't let anyone touch the UI
  at all until you're done iterating via the API. If a "verified" fix
  mysteriously regresses with no PUT of your own in between, `GET /spec`
  first and diff against what you last pushed before assuming you introduced
  a new bug — you may be looking at exactly this.
- **A bare `[col]` formula does NOT reach the raw SQL output on a custom-SQL
  table that hand-authors its own `columns` array — it needs
  `[Custom SQL/col]` (the raw query result has an implicit source name
  `"Custom SQL"`, even referenced from inside the very element that IS the
  SQL source).** Getting this wrong is dangerously silent at POST/PUT time —
  the spec saves fine — and only shows up when someone actually opens the
  workbook: every cell in that column renders the literal string
  `Unknown column "[col]"`, and every DOWNSTREAM element (a linked input
  table, a chart, a KPI) shows an unrelated-looking cascade error —
  `"Invalid Argument: Join key contains type error"` — pointing at the wrong
  element entirely. **If you see that error on a linked-input-table/chart,
  go check the upstream custom-SQL table's own column formulas first**,
  even though the error text doesn't mention it. This is exactly the kind of
  bug POST-time validation and even export-based QA (see below) will not
  catch — only opening it in-browser (or a screenshot from someone who did)
  surfaced it here.
- **The qualification rule applies at EVERY hop, not just the raw-SQL one.**
  A chart/KPI sourcing from a plain derived table (`source:{elementId:"book",
  kind:"table"}`) still needs `[Book/statfcst]`, not bare `[statfcst]`, even
  though `book` itself is a completely ordinary table one clean hop above the
  linked input table. This bit AGAIN, one layer further downstream, after
  the `Custom SQL/` fix above — a line chart and 3 of 4 KPIs all silently
  saved fine and only failed once opened in-browser (`Unknown column
  "[statfcst]"`), because export-based QA on `book` itself (the direct
  parent) passed, and it's tempting to stop checking once the immediate
  parent resolves. **Check every element that reads from another element,
  not just the first hop from raw SQL** — the rule is "bare bracket = same-
  element sibling only," full stop; anything crossing an element boundary
  needs `[<parent's `name`>/<column>]`, all the way down the chain.
- **Circular column reference is a related but distinct trap.** Declaring a
  passthrough/aggregate column with `formula:"[demand_fcst]"` AND
  `name:"demand_fcst"` (same string) makes the bare bracket resolve to the
  sibling column itself — Sigma rejects it: `"Circular column reference to
  [demand_fcst]"`. **Fix: always give a declared column a display `name`
  that's textually different from the raw column name in its own `formula`
  bracket** (and, per the bullet above, qualify the SOURCE side with
  `Custom SQL/` when it's a same-element raw-SQL reference).
- **Once a linked input table's column type has materialized wrong (e.g.
  inferred as `text` because its upstream source was erroring), a later PUT
  that fixes the upstream and would change that column to `number` is
  rejected: `"type change is not supported... Drop and re-add the column to
  change its type."`** PUT can't silently retype a column in place. Give the
  WHOLE input-table element a fresh id (forcing Sigma to treat it as a new
  element, re-inferring types clean) rather than trying to patch the
  existing one. This only bites when iterating on a spec that already got
  PUT once with an upstream bug — a correct from-scratch build won't hit it.
- **`controlId` can't contain dots on POST-create.** Must match
  `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,64}$`. Some UI-built production workbooks GET-back with
  dotted controlIds (`c.relative_month`) — that's legacy/UI-only naming; a
  fresh API-created control can't reuse that convention. Use underscores.
- **Correction (2026-08-15): `controlType:"slider"` DOES exist** — the
  earlier claim below was wrong, caught only because the user pasted a
  screenshot of Sigma's live control-picker UI showing `Slider` and `Range
  slider` as real options. Verified end-to-end (verify -> create -> real
  Playwright screenshot of a live workbook, not just schema validation):
  ```json
  {"kind": "control", "controlId": "c_x", "controlType": "slider",
   "mode": "=", "low": -20, "high": 20, "step": 1, "value": 0}
  ```
  The field names are **`low`/`high`, not `min`/`max`** — passing `min`/`max`
  is silently ignored (no error) and Sigma falls back to a default `low:0,
  high:100` range, which renders successfully but with the wrong bounds. This
  is the dangerous failure mode: `verify` and `create` both return success
  with the wrong field names, so the only way to catch it is to GET the spec
  back and check what actually landed, or screenshot the live control.
  `"range-slider"` is presumably the two-handle sibling (not yet verified).
  ~~`controlType:"slider"` does not exist. Valid types (confirmed across this
  skill's examples): `list`, `number`, `text`, `text-area`, `date`,
  `segmented`, `checkbox`. For a bare numeric input, use `controlType:"number",
  mode:"="`.~~ (superseded, kept struck through as a record of the mistake)
- **A standalone control's live value is NOT bracket-referenceable from an
  arbitrary other element's formula.** There's no verified `[ControlName]`
  formula primitive for "read whatever this slider is currently set to" outside
  of the control's own `filters`/`source` wiring. If you want a value a user
  adjusts to flow into a chart/KPI, route it through an editable **input
  table column** (per `scenario-modeler-pattern.md`), not a bare control.
- **Every element must appear in the layout XML in this environment,
  including pure "backend" tables** that exist only as sources for other
  elements (a base SQL table, a downstream "Book" read-surface). Omitting one
  is a hard validation error (`element 'X' is not placed in layout`) — this
  contradicts guidance from a different Sigma environment that unplaced
  elements "auto-stack." Give every element a real (even tiny/out-of-the-way)
  `<Element>` placement.
- **`<br>` is not an allowed inline tag in a `text` element's `body`.**
  Allowed set: `<u>`, `<sub>`, `<sup>`, `<span>`, `<a>`. Use separate `text`
  elements (or a single line) instead of a manual line break.
- **The `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` "My Documents root" folderId
  convention is NOT universal.** In one org it resolved to an *archived*
  folder literally named after the org (`"Folder \"demeng\" archived"`).
  Look up the real folder id: `GET /v2/files?typeFilters=folder&search=<name>`
  and use an entry whose `path` is exactly `"My Documents"` (its `parentId`
  is the org's true My-Documents root).
- **Don't conclude "export/live-query is broken for this token" too early —
  first rule out a real spec bug.** Every custom-SQL element on one
  connection, including a trivial `SELECT 1` probe, initially failed export
  with a generic masked 500 (`"Export failed ... with errors"`), which read
  like the known "API service token can't carry interactive OAuth" limit
  seen in other environments. It wasn't that — it was the `[Custom SQL/col]`
  qualification bug above; once fixed, export worked cleanly end-to-end,
  including through the linked input table. A masked 500 on a *trivial*
  probe query is genuinely ambiguous between "this token/connection can't
  run live queries" and "something upstream in this exact spec silently
  errors" — don't commit to either conclusion without independent
  confirmation (e.g. a DIFFERENT, definitely-correct element on the same
  connection exporting fine).
